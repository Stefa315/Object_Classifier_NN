Link for the SampleK folder which contains 6 areas with different specimens inside. Images acquired from Microscope have high resolution 

so the classification and the reconstruction of the images became by dividing the area in smaller tiles. Every area has 225 images, after downloading the SampleK place 

the Folder inside your Project and not in your venv.It also contains some of my own classifications with a variety of different combinations of modalities.

Combinations : 20 Modes // Color + Reflectance on the Visible Spectrum // Only Reflectance Visible // Reflectance Visible and Ultraviolet + Polarized + Color + 

Fluorescencce with 450nm Wavelegth // Color + Reflectance Visible and Ultraviolet + 3 Fluorescence Modes (365,405,465nm) + Polarized + 5 Bands of Hyperspctral Imaging
