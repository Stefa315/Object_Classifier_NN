This Link is for my GoogleDrive. It contains all the different combinations of modalities that i did for my research on my thesis. Every folder contains a requirements.txt
that has a description about which combinations were used. It can not be used without the models from the Convolutional Neural Networks, but if you train the CNNs 
you dont have to train the Fully-Connected Neural Network that works as a decoder.
