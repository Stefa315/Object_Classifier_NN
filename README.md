# Object_Classifier_NN
Multi-Spectral Object Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks trained with unique dataset acquired from Microscope.

Microscope can capture the same specimen in many different appearances depending on its capabilities. The one i could use in the lab had 5 different modalities

for capturing an image. The dataset i created is unique so it may be difficult to be tested on other images with different specifications or appearances but it is 

programmed to work with any kind of combination that you choose between the available 20 capturing modalities(1-20). So, you can test this one with the existing dataset
or create your own dataset and train again this CNNs.

Microscope's Utilities :

Brightfield Microscopy(RGB Image)
Reflectance Microscopy: Ultraviolet Spectrum and Visible Spectrum
Polarized Microscopy
Fluorescence Microscopy: Light Source at 365nm, 405nm, 450nm
Hyperspectral Microscopy: 13 Bands between 325nm-1000nm
